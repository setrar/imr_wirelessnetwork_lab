    "We emulate in this section a small network where the base station provided a broadband service to several users. Each group of student is associated to a device (i.e a mobile terminal) and has a unique identifier. This identifier will be used to extract the dedicated payload content from the multiplexed stream. The ultimate purpose is to decode the sent text and discover the secret key that has been hide for each user in the frame. In the proposed lab, we will focus on the L2 part: we will suppose that we will have a time frequency grid from the low layer (L1) and that this matrix has been obtained from an over the air transmission. The purpose is to recover the payload associated to your group identifier and discover the secret key hidden in the payload content.\n",

    "To do so, we will have to decode all the channels that are multiplexed in the received LTE frame. Each channel has a specific information that will be used to sequentially obtained all the necessary flags and parameters for the final payload decoding.We will first have to built the necessary functions to recover all the parameters, and then apply the successive decoding functions."
